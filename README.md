# Flow: idea tracker

- The aim with this program is to be able to track the flow of things in a
  terminal and in an easy to understand way.
- Text records are fine but graphs/flowcharts are better.
- So flow represents different states/milestones of a process to make new people
  understand the idea and the background development behind it easily.
- See the `docs/README.md` for design details.
